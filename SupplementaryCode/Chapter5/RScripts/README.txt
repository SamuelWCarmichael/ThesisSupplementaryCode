As usual, these R scripts handle all the plotting etc. and assume that the data is stored in the same folder. No data included, but can be generated with the simulations.
- bonustrajectoryplotter.R plots some sample trajectories we use for visual aids in the thesis.
- multilineplotter.R handles figures 5.3 and 5.4, with the updated colours etc.
- networksampleplotter.R produces the same networks. It cannot combine them with other graphical elements, this must be done by hand. It also can only produce them one at a time - it breaks otherwise!
- violinplotter.R handles all the violin plots used in Chapter 5.
