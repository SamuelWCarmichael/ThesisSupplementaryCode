This is the R script specific readme file. For the overview, see the readme in the main folder.

The two files should be fairly self-explanatory - they do what the names suggest.
Some notes on usage:
- All input files are assumed to be in the same folder as the files, or rather, in the folder you designate your working directory.
- the code is ready to run. However, you will need to specify your working directory and the filenames you choose for the input files, and alter the relevant bits of the code accordingly.
- The code has been optimised gradually but is still not always fast. Allow a couple of hours if you choose to run the entire script at once.
