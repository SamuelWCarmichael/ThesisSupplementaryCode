The RScripts assume all data is placed into this folder (though you can update that in the actual scripts as usual).
- ch3mainplotter.R handles the bulk of the plots focusing on the performance of the R0 estimate.
- ch3mainplotterpt2.R handles the followup figures about the endemic threshold.
- ch3supplementaryplotter.R produces a couple of extra figures that were not used, or were partly incorporated into the main figures.
Largely only the first two files are needed, but I include the bonus plotter just in case it is of interest.
