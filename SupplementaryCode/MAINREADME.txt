This repository (of sorts) contains all the code needed to reproduce my simulation output and graphs. It does not include my data, however! Since all output is simulation-derived, the results should be replicable
without it. I will endeavor to update and maintain the repository, particularly if some files are missing/broken - but I provide no guarantees that the code will work on all versions of R and MATLAB.

I have tested the code extensively on the following versions:
RStudio v2022.07.1 Build 554, R version 4.1.0.
MATLAB 2021b, v9.11.0.1769968.
Support of more recent versions in particular is not guaranteed!
